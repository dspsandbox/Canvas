You are now in a Docker container running Arch. To build your app
for this platform, use the normal commands `fbs freeze` etc.

Note that you can't launch GUIs here. So eg. `fbs run` won't work.

Another caveat is that target/ here is special: It symlinks to your
usual target/arch/. So when you are done and type `exit` to leave
this container, you can find the produced binaries there.
