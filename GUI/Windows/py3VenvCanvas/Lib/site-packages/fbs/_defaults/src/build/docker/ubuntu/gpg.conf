# Old GPG versions (including the one we use, on Ubuntu 14) use SHA-1 by
# default. Recent Ubuntu versions (in particular, >= 18) no longer allow this
# and give "The following signatures were invalid" when `apt-get update` fetches
# our SHA-1 signed reprepro repository. The following setting ensures that our
# reprepro uses SHA-256 instead:
