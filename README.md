# NET2FPGA
## Visual prototyping and signal processing on Zynq FPGAs

The NET2FPGA project is a visual FPGA programming tool, which starting from a LTspice toolbox, automates code generation, sythesis and implementation on the target device. The NET2FPGA software bundle drastically reduces the time required for generating custom digital signal processing (DSP) solutions and opens the field for users without prior knowlegde on VHDL/Verilog nor FPGA architechture.
